What grade you expect to receive

180pt

Why you expect to get that grade.

I meet all the requirements for 140 points.
I use about 30 classes and ids to do styling.
I use about 15 rules in each media query.

A write-up of your "extras"
I add a "skip nav" function, as well as  "tabindex" on everything navigation item to enhance accessibility.
I add the lightbox plugin to show the image gallary and change the default resize setting to make the transition between imgaes quicker.
I create a separate js file to run jQuery code on the dropdown menu on the mobile style: one to change the icon, one to hide the dropdown when user scrolling.
I add "name" field for every input element and use the "getform" to do some backend saving for the contact form.
